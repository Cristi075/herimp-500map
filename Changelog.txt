	Fixed Fx Buttons: Now each fx control the activation of both deck1 and Deck2
		lights are not properly setup yet, knobs not yet working
	Added shift function to sampler: now it will pause (cue) the relative sample

Start:
	Added Fx buttons: they toggle on/off FX effects but only on one deck (not on
		both decks)
	Added Fx Lights. Tested and working (maybe the light is not enough bright)
