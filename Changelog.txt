6:
	small fixes for beatmatch.
	Added support for double Tempo for beatmatch
	Slicer: Ported and Greatly improved the slicer. Only problem is that:
		"Jump forward by beatjump_size (positive) or backward by beatjump_size
		(negative). If a loop is active, the loop is moved by beatjump_size"
		so I decided to put the loop slicer as default.


5:
	Fixed a bug: Shift + scratchWheel. It was not a function.
	Added slowed pause function: can be activated separated per deck with
		shift+vinyl.
	Removed an output for FX that seemed not connectd to anything
	Added BPM beatmatch guide.

4:
	Added Pad 7 bottom functions (slider resolution, shift to reset). Still
		missing leds, still missing left and right bottom buttons.
	Added Pad 7 top functions for key changes. Still missing LEDs
	Added Fx4 function for deck select, also filterknob behavior depend on it
	Fixed LED
	Modified Fx and FilterKnob: now Fx4 selects the deck for both buttons and
		knobs. Shift + button resets everything. Fixed Fx only connected to
		deck1. Led still missing

3:
	Shift + Sync: changed to "match key" since it was redundant with long press
		(still missing reset tempo)
	Fixed Fx LED
	Added behavior for filter knobs: now if at least one effect is active they
		will propery control the dry/wet knob of the control. Here there was
		also the possibility to attach this to the super-effects-knob (green)
		but I decided that the wet/dry is better. Tell me if you have different
		ideas
	Fixed Quantize button: now properly activate quatize, instead shift+quantize
		activates the keylock

2:
	Fixed Fx Buttons: Now each fx control the activation of both deck1 and Deck2
		lights are not properly setup yet, knobs not yet working
	Added shift function to sampler: now it will pause (cue) the relative sample

Start:
	Added Fx buttons: they toggle on/off FX effects but only on one deck (not on
		both decks)
	Added Fx Lights. Tested and working (maybe the light is not enough bright)
