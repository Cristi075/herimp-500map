1: managed to connect the button to the mixxx, but:
  A: the knob is not controlling the overall fx (red knob in mixxx)
    the red knob: EffectRack1_EffectUnit1 mix PArameter: 0.5 Direction FROM_AND_TO_WIDGET emit: PRESS
2: obtain the beat align lights from wireshark
    jog lights up at the end of the song (I can get the signal)

3: shift sync to syncronizhe key

4: mode 5: fix key -1 -0.5 + 0.5 + 1 - (below)

5: sampler: shit+number to pause
    also both left and right command the same 8 samplers. I think it is ok, but maybe improve

6: the browser knob: don't make it flash as default but make it change color based on the point of the song execution (violet to red when the song is ending)

7: fx lights are messed up
