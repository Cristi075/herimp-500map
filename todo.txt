done:          A: when fx4=0 (default) Fx1-3 flip the state. It's ok but not when only one is active. I need to make all active and then start flipping.
                (all active first since if I want to disable everything there is still shift+key)
            B: LED are only on deck 1
            1: fx 1-3:  enabled both: on
                        enabled on only 1 or 2: blinking
                        disabled all: off
                shift press = reset the state to 0 - off
               fx 4: press: change activation based on state: Deck 1 only (on), deck 2 only (blinking), off (off)
               shift press = reset the state to 0 - off
                        What?
                            change everything in the fxplace: buttons and knobs
                            il punto è: voglio che le knob funzionino solo in base allo stato degli fx o voglio controllarle anche con fx4?
                            voglio anche con fx4

2: obtain the beat align lights from wireshark
    jog lights up at the end of the song (I can get the signal)

4: mode 5: fix key -1 -0.5 + 0.5 + 1 - (below)

5: the 3 mode on the crossfader (smooth, abrupt and circle)
    need to understand where they go in mixxx

6: the browser knob: don't make it flash as default but make it change color based on the point of the song execution (violet to red when the song is ending)

8: when I press shift a lot of lights disappear (but not the hot cue ones)
    it can be cool to exploit this behavior

10: in the .js init() function there are 4 deprecated call (connectControl)

11: I don't understand Sysex messages: not implemented

12: Soft-takeover for pitch and other stuff (like also fx knobs)
    I can put soft take overs also in the xml file (maybe better)

13: check jogwheel functionality

14: The color of hotcues is accessible with engine.getValue('[ChannelN]', 'hotcue_X_color')
    (where N and X are the respective Deck and hotcue whose information is being accessed) as an RGB color code

15: Reset tempo (cannot do with shift + sync since it is already taken)
        NO:I can put shift+sync = reset tempo. then put all key stuff on a pad.
            because i should not need to reset tempo so brutally

16: look at other consoles for pad functionalities

17: pad 7:
        -1tone -1 semitone + 1 semitone + 1tone
        -2xtempo -1xtempo +1x tempo +2x tempo (regarding pitch slider control unit measure)

18: loop functions (shift etc) look main dj software

19: shift+keychange = reset key. led pad 7

20: to fix tempo the jog are really bad sensitivity. Fix it (succede solo se la canzone è in stop, probabilmente è più un problema di mixxx che del mapping)

21: assistant = AutoDJ

22: shift+knob per scalare di 10 in 10

23: fix errors in --developer mode
