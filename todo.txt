1: managed to connect the button to the mixxx, but:
  A: the knob is not controlling the overall fx (red knob in mixxx)
    the red knob: EffectRack1_EffectUnit1/2, mix -  Parameter: 0.5 Direction FROM_AND_TO_WIDGET emit: PRESS
    also there is presenta super knob (green) EffectRack1_EffectUnit1/2, super1
        but i think it is better the dry wet one
    Steps:
        1: test the normal behavior
            A: I connect only deck1 to callback
            B: LED are only on deck 1
        2: improve on that

2: obtain the beat align lights from wireshark
    jog lights up at the end of the song (I can get the signal)

4: mode 5: fix key -1 -0.5 + 0.5 + 1 - (below)

5: the 3 mode on the crossfader (smooth, abrupt and circle)
    need to understand where they go in mixxx

6: the browser knob: don't make it flash as default but make it change color based on the point of the song execution (violet to red when the song is ending)

7: fx lights are messed up

8: when I press shift a lot of lights disappear (but not the hot cue ones)
    it can be cool to exploit this behavior

10: in the .js init() function there are 4 deprecated call (connectControl)

11: I don't understand Sysex messages: not implemented

12: Soft-takeover for pitch and other stuff (like also fx knobs)
    I can put soft take overs also in the xml file (maybe better)

13: check jogwheel functionality

14: The color of hotcues is accessible with engine.getValue('[ChannelN]', 'hotcue_X_color')
    (where N and X are the respective Deck and hotcue whose information is being accessed) as an RGB color code

15: Reset tempo (cannot do with shift + sync since it is already taken)
